# Live-Simulator-Processing-
This "https://processing.org" project simulates, in a simple way, society fighting for resources. 

Its increadible how can we use processing to create amazing things.

In this software each time you click, you will generate a new individual (represented as dots). This individuals wil lneed to find resources to survive, at the same time they will age, and finally die. However if there is too much population, resources are going to become scarce, makeing the population decrease before they age. As you see a decreasing population you will pass through a point of equilibrium, were the population is just enought to survive, until the age and die.
